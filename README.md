I like working on Macs and using zsh. This is my basic dev config - it includes some shell/git/Docker aliases that I find helpful, as well as basic git config. All of these files go in the user's root directory.

How to use:

1. Install homebrew.
2. Copy repo files to home dir.
3. Modify details in `.gitconfig`.
